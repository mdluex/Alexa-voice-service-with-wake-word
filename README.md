Install AVS on the Raspberry Pi with the wake word and enable it at startup.

Here is how

### 1ST  increasing the swap size:

Enter the following commands into the terminal

1. ```sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff```

2. ```sudo mousepad /etc/dphys-swapfile``` and change ```CONF_SWAPSIZE=100``` to ```CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024```

3. ```sudo dphys-swapfile setup```

4. ```sudo dphys-swapfile swapon```

5. Reboot the device ```sudo reboot```

### 2ND installing the Amazone Alexa Voice Service:

[Open this link and follow the instructions](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/raspberry-pi-script.html)

### 3RD sitting up the wake word:

1. [Create a Pico Voice account and copy your Access Key from this link](https://console.picovoice.ai/)

2. Open a terminal and enter the following commands

```
cd /home/pi/ \
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdluex/Alexa-voice-service-with-wake-word/main/requirements.txt \
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdluex/Alexa-voice-service-with-wake-word/main/wword.py \
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdluex/Alexa-voice-service-with-wake-word/main/runAlexa.sh \
wget https://github.com/mdluex/Alexa-voice-service-with-wake-word/blob/main/alexa_en_raspberry-pi_v2_1_0.ppn?raw=true
```

3. Install python requirements ```sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Edit the runAlexa.sh file to include your Pico Voice access key ```sudo mousepad runAlexa.sh```

5. Change the runAlexa.sh file permissions ```sudo chmod +x runAlexa.sh```

6. Change the startsample.sh file permissions ```sudo chmod +x startsample.sh```

7. Adding our script to run at stratup ```sudo mousepad /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart```

8. Add this line ```@lxterminal --command="./runAlexa.sh"``` before this line ```@xscreensaver -no-splash``` and save the file

9. Reboot the device ```sudo reboot```

10. Everything should work after rebooting; however, you cannot use the device through the GUI while our script is running because it is emulating keyboard presses.
